# CS50-Todo-List-Final-Project
A web application which provides a simple todo list functionality. Use it to share a single todo list with your friends. The list updates on everyone's screen in real time, and you can make tasks private if you don't want others to see them.

The web application was created using [Meteor (web framework)](https://www.meteor.com/).

You can see the demo at [YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RQaxwcSR8).
